## New Year's and COVID-19

After the last 3 years the whole world has experienced together, let's hope 2024 will be better. While it has been almost 4 years since the beginning of lockdown in most places, Covid-19 still exists, spreads and kills, please do not pretend like this is over. As research continues showing more and more effects of being infected with COVID-19, I urge you all to still maintain safety practices similar to what was done in the heat of the lockdown. This will never go away unless everyone who is *capable* of maintaining strong safety practices does so, we must wear masks for those who cannot, we must get vaccinations and boosters for those who cannot, this does not work unless **all of us** are in it together. COVID-19 is not over, don't act like it is, it'll only result in it lasting longer.

## COVID-19 and Dementia

A lot of people are now underestimating the effects of Covid without proper research and belittling it to the point of convincing themselves and others that they do not need to take basic measures to ensure you do not catch or spread Covid. So, with less and less people following research of Covid, what is really going on, right now? Let's examine a [National Institutes of Health article](https://covid19.nih.gov/news-and-stories/rapid-progression-dementia-following-covid-19) covering a, to be fair, relatively small test conducted by NINDS on the impact of COVID-19 on dementia patients. In literally the first paragraph, it is immediately stated that "COVID-19 can cause long-term problems with thinking, concentrating, and remembering."

COVID-19 does not just affect our lungs, it affects our entire nervous system, and this is one of it's scarier symptoms. The researchers at NINDS studied patients that had enrolled in a dementia study and had COVID-19 during said study, while at most 5 had the same type of dementia, after catching COVID-19, they all shared similar dementia symptoms, they experienced brain deterioration after catching COVID-19.

## Long Covid

I wanted to go into detail on this but this isn't something I want to pour a lot of time into, this is more like a less brainrot-y (bad word choice for the subject) social media post. I may update this later on or continue it in a more extensive post but that's all for now.
