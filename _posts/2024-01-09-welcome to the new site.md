## Site Changes

Hello there and welcome to my brand new website! With a new year, a new website only felt natural to do (also the old one kinda stunk). First thing you'll probably notice is that you're no longer being flashbanged the moment you load the site, that was due to the [jekyll site](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme that I was at the time using not releasing it's 3.0 update, but pushing documentation for the 3.0 update. The lack of the actual update with the presence of the documentation ended with me creating a broken site that was trying to use 3.0 features, but was still on 2.0. For those of you that visited the site when I had deleted the original repository to work on this site, you'll probably have seen something like this:

I felt that just letting the site display an error rather than having an unifinished site would be less confusing, think of it as really fucking weird downtime.

## New Year's and COVID

After the last 3 years the whole world has experienced together, let's hope 2024 will be better. While it has been almost 4 years since the beginning of lockdown in most places, Covid-19 still exists, spreads and kills, please do not pretend like this is over. As research continues showing more and more effects of being infected with Covid-19, I urge you all to still maintain safety practices similar to what was done in the heat of the lockdown. This will never go away unless everyone who is *capable* of maintaining strong safety practices does so, we must wear masks for those who cannot, we must get vaccinations and boosters for those who cannot, this does not work unless **all of us** are in it together. Covid is not over, don't act like it is, it'll only result in it lasting longer.
