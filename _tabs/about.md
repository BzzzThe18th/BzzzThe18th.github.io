Hi, my name is Buzz, I go by any pronouns, I do not mind what you use, but I do prefer they/them or she/her. I am a VR enthusiast and excited to see what heights it can bring us to in the coming years as VR technology grows. I am working towards a career programming, specifically backend and lower level development as understanding concepts such as data ownership proposes a challenge to me that enables me to learn to take my time.
