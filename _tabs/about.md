Hi, my name is Buzz, but my name is about as much identifying information you'll get about me. I am a VR enthusiast and excited to see what heights it can bring us to in the coming years as VR technology grows. I am working towards a career in software development and engineering, and looking to challenge myself with lower level concepts that I struggle with.
